<b>1. Test your problem-solving skills</b><br>
There’s nothing more satisfying than solving a problem that’s been around for a while and nobody else knows how to solve. As a Software Developer you constantly provide solutions for users’ problems. You can be working on the occasional quick fix as well as more complex strategic solutions. Some problem-solving skills required to be a Software Developer include being able to split complex goals into smaller, more manageable ones. You should also be able to think in parallel. This means taking your smaller tasks, rearranging them and seeing if any are unnecessary so you can optimise your tasks and save time. Likewise, in an attempt to save time, a Software Engineer will need to design future-proof solutions that do not need re-designing each time a parameter changes. Remember not everything needs to be designed from scratch too. Be resourceful and consider existing tools before you start on a new solution; you may find you can skip a few steps.
<b>2. Get creative with code</b><br>
Being in Software Development isn’t quite the same as being a Graphic Designer or Fine Artist, but that doesn’t mean it’s not creative in its own way. There are many ways in which Software Developers can be creative, including in the way you think to solve a problem: for example, you need to be able to put yourself in the users’ shoes in order to provide a solution, you need to create innovative new systems and functionality and you get to play around and learn new technologies. Creativity also comes into play when trying to design a well-thought complex solution to get the best out of computers. You begin with just a blank screen and a set of abstract ideas to construct your masterpiece using code. Creativity is just one of the many reasons to become a Software Engineer.
<b>3. Project-based work structure</b><br>
Another reason to become a Software Developer is the varied work structure which is project-based. Generally, you will be working on a huge variety of projects, both large and small, and there are so many advantages to this working style. Each new project that you work on brings a whole new set of challenges and gives you the opportunity to learn about new technologies, different systems, and explore various parts of the business. Project-based work also gives you a sense of structure as, most likely, you have a timeframe to work towards before you can finish and move on to the next exciting project.
<b>4. Continuous learning opportunities</b><br>
Technology is extremely fast moving, so Software Engineers need to be able to learn new programming languages and technologies and adapt to the continually changing environment. Alongside learning about technology, developers will often have the opportunity to develop their knowledge about the business and sector they are working in, as these are also ever-changing. This constant change is an amazing learning opportunity, keeping your mind fresh and the job interesting! What better reason do you need to get started in Software Engineering?
<b>5. Collaboration across teams</b><br>
The stereotype of a programmer sitting in a room alone, coding all day, is actually very far from reality and very few developers work alone. In addition to technical skills, you need to be a great communicator and team player. You will often need to work as part of a team to share your knowledge and ideas and expand your understanding of good development practises, as well as how systems work to ensure you achieve the best end product. As a Developer, you will spend a lot of time collaborating with colleagues from multiple different departments, which means you have the chance to learn from others. “Communication skills are important. A great deal of my role involves communicating with my team mates, as well as other internal clients, effectively, whether you are discussing a bug that needs to be fixed, planning an upcoming release or talking to a client about a certain feature.” Michael, Software Developer in Macquarie’s Trade Service department Read more about Michael’s story on becoming a Software </p>
